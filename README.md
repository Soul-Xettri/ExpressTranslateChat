# ExpressTranslateChat

ExpressTranslateChat is a real-time chat translator built with Node.js and Express.js.

## Overview

This project allows users to send messages in one language, and the messages are translated in real-time based on the preferred language of the recipient. The communication is facilitated using Socket.io, and translation is performed using a translation API (e.g., Google Translate).
